Recursion
---------

* [Inscription 12992](https://ordinals.com/inscription/bf637552f3758e20f733d1f250cbea7cbbb4bbf157a8d4a9c26132950a383415i0) was the first recursive inscription inscribed on mainnet.
* [OnChain Monkey Genesis (BTC)](https://ordinals.com/children/fb162a46943e5d7d31d72ee2c8c850e66c1ca5d0d453068aa63883528285ed21i0) was one of the earliest collections to use recursion to create its PFP art.
* [Blob](https://ordinals.com/inscription/67285791) is a recursive generative collection that seeds its generation with metadata and uses threeJS, React 3 Fiber and other libraries recursively.
* The [GPU Ordinals](https://ordinals.com/inscription/0b62d8790bb428e0278cd8c3dedd540e2495515198002a233a49ba7b21f8b2cei0) collection takes recursive content and transforms it before rendering, creating what is termed as 'super-recursion'.  Use Google Chrome and headphones to experience the spatial audio.
* The [Abstractii Genesis](https://ordinals.com/inscription/b2de70a5658d3659b74a9a349e02ed9396318eab844073b6f35e726dea9e103ei0) collection uses the inscriptions ID as a seed to generate its art.
* The [Abstractii Evolved](https://ordinals.com/inscription/c56795a454a30bb6866686770f14d015d53f3cf2ddfa5154e34a7cd1120a51efi0) generative collection uses the recursive blockheight endpoint as a seed to generate its art.
* [This code](http://ordinals.com/content/eafb859825cd843587d39552eb7a52f352e9621cd16b63b8702c1b8ea44faf1ci0) is called recursively in [this inscription](https://ordinals.com/inscription/60445754) to generate music.
* [This code](https://ordinals.com/content/e48af8aebe608656a3739393d1270d88285ab3051fb800743509d82bcf163623i0) is called recursively in [this inscription](https://ordinals.com/inscription/70940369), allowing it to function as a pixel art drawing program.
